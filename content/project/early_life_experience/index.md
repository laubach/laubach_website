In hyenas, humans and birds, my collaborators and I use life course models to test hypotheses about how the type and timing of early life social expereinces 'get under an organism's skin'. In particular we are investigating the molecular mechanisms that link social experience with development of persistent future phenotypes. Ulitmately, we are interested in the fitness consequences of these social experiences, and if these relationships are generalizeable across diverse taxa. Investigating these questions rely on collaborations and use of invaluable long-term data on spotted hyenas (The Mara Hyena Project), humans (Project Viva), and barn swallows (Safran Lab Barn Swallow Project).
